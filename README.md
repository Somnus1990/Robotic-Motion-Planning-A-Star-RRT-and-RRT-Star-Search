# Robotic-Motion-Planning-A-Star-RRT-and-RRT-Star-Search
## Introduction
<br>Motion planning is a term used in robotics for the process of breaking down the desired movement task into discrete motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement. In this project, I implemented A star, RRT and RRT star method for a motion planning task. I assigned the start point and end point and these method will find a optimal planning.
## A Star
<br>Input: A* is a graph search algorithms, which take a “graph” as input. A graph is a set of locations (“nodes”) and the connections (“edges”) between them. A* selects the path that minimizes f(n)=g(n)+h(n) where n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, and h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal.
<br> So if we change the weight of heuristic function, the result of A* will change.
<br>The algorithm in pseudocode is as follows:

<br>Although the RRT algorithm is a relatively efficient one, the RRT algorithm does not guarantee that the resulting planning path is relatively optimized. The main feature of the RRT* algorithm is that it can quickly find the initial path, and then continue to optimize as the sampling point increases until the target point is found or the set maximum number of cycles is reached. The difference between the RRT* algorithm and the RRT algorithm lies in the two recalculation processes for the new node x_new, which are:
<br>The process of re-selecting the parent node for x_new
<br>The process of rerouting a random tree
<br>The algorithm in pseudocode is as follows:
